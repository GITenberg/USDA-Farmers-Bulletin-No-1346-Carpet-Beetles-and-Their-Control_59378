<p>CARPET BEETLES, or so-called "buffalo moths,"
are common household pests usually associated
in their destructive work with clothes moths. Ordinarily
they are not so destructive as clothes moths,
because they reproduce only once a year, and then
not so abundantly.</p>

<p>Experienced housewives throughout the North are
familiar with the stout, oval, reddish-brown, hairy
grubs or larv&aelig; of the common carpet beetle, found
beneath carpets or in clothing. In southern homes,
however, the longer, slender, golden-brown larva of
the black carpet beetle, with its tuft of golden
bristles, is more common.</p>

<p>All carpet-beetle larv&aelig; feed upon fabrics or upon
various articles, including upholstered furniture,
containing wool, silk, hair, fur, bristles, or feathers.
They even feed upon dried animal matter.</p>

<p>Protection against carpet beetles can be secured
in tight chests and trunks by the use of the crystals
of naphthalene, paradichlorobenzene, or camphor,
or by the fumigants carbon disulphid and carbon
tetrachloride Where infestation is general throughout
a house or is serious in closets, it may be advisable
to fumigate with hydrocyanic-acid gas, carbon
disulphid, or sulphur, but none of these fumigation
methods should be employed except by a person well
informed regarding them. The foregoing remedies
and others, such as cold storage, red-cedar chests,
heat, and the treatment of infested floor cracks, are
discussed in this bulletin.</p>

<p class="p0">HE so-called "buffalo moths" are not moths; they are beetles
and very distinct from the true clothes moths. In this country
there are six species,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> at least, that attack museum materials and
household fabrics, but of these only four<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> have proved serious household
pests in America. All species are capable of subsisting upon
dried animal remains, and thrive upon them perhaps as well as upon
the fine fabrics of wool, hair, feathers, fur, and silk.</p>

<p>Carpet beetles pass through life cycles, or generations, consisting
of egg, larva or grub, pupa, and adult or beetle. These stages differ
greatly in appearance. The beetles are broadly oval and about
three-sixteenths to one-fourth of an inch long; black, but with this
blackness often obscured by tiny red, orange, brown, yellow, or white
scales which form color designs characteristic of the species. These
scales, which are modified hairs, are easily rubbed off, revealing the
black color of the body beneath. The larv&aelig;, or grubs (as the larv&aelig;
of beetles are often called) are brownish or black and variously
clothed with stiff hairs, as shown in Figures <a href="#fig1">1</a> and <a href="#fig8">8</a>, or with a long
tuft of hairs at the end of the body, as shown in <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>. Carpet
beetles pass through not more than two generations annually, and
more often only one, and there are records of certain individuals requiring
much longer, even three years, to complete their growth.
The following accounts are given of the four most important species.</p>

<p>The common carpet beetle was known as <i>the</i> carpet beetle in the
years following its introduction into America when floors were more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"> 2 </a></span>
commonly than, now covered entirely with carpets that were tacked
down along the edges, thus giving the larv&aelig; an undisturbed shelter
favorable to their development. Originally a pest in Europe, where
it is still common, it was introduced into this country about 1874,
probably at Boston and New York simultaneously. No stage of this
common carpet beetle is longer than three-sixteenths to one-fourth
of an inch. The general proportions of larva, pupa, and adult are
shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>. The rich reddish brown larv&aelig; are clothed with
stiff dark brown hairs which are longer around the sides, and still
longer at the ends, than upon the back.</p>

</div>

<p>The larv&aelig; feed upon carpets and woolens (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>), furs, feathers
(<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>), bristles, and silks. They remain secluded in dark places,
hidden beneath carpets or in the folds of garments. They eat irregular
holes in fabrics, but in carpets tacked to floors they are more
likely to eat slits following cracks. They never cause a webbing on
the fabric.</p>

<p>While most conspicuous in the Northern States, this carpet beetle is
frequently found in the latitude of Washington, D. C, and southward
Specimens have, recently been sent from Texas and Florida.
In a Washington storehouse the contents of a trunk closed for several
years were found badly damaged by the larv&aelig;.</p>

<p>The following account<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> is just as applicable to-day as when written
many years ago.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The adult insect is a small, broad-oval beetle, about three-sixteenths of an
inch long, black in color, but is covered with exceedingly minute scales, which
give it a marbled black-and-white appearance. It also has a red stripe down the
middle of the back, widening into projections at three intervals. When disturbed
it "plays 'possum," folding up its legs and antenn&aelig; and feigning death
As a general thing the beetles begin to appear in the fall, and continue to
issue, in heated houses, throughout the winter and following spring. Soon after
issuing they pair, and the females lay their eggs in convenient spots. The
eggs hatch, under favorable conditions, in a few days, and the larv&aelig;, with plenty
of food, develop quite rapidly. Their development is retarded by cold weather
or lack of food, and they remain alive in the larval state, in such conditions
and particularly in a dry atmosphere, for an almost indefinite period molting
frequently and feeding upon their cast skins. Under normal conditions, however
the skin is cast about six times, and there are, probably, in the North,
not more than two annual generations. When the larva reaches full growth
the yellowish pupa is formed within the last larval skin. Eventually this skin
splits down the back and reveals the pupa, from which the beetle emerges later.
The beetles are day fliers, and when not engaged in egg laying are attracted to
the light. They fly to the windows, and may often be found upon the sills or panes.
Where they can fly out through an open window they do so, and are strongly
attracted to the flowers of certain plants, particularly the family Scrophulariace&aelig;
but also to certain Composite, such as milfoil (<i>Achillea millefolium</i>).
The flowers of Spir&aelig;a are also strongly attractive to the beetles. It is probable,
however, that this migration from the house takes place, under ordinary circumstances
after the eggs have been laid.</p>

</div>

<p>In Europe the insect is not especially noted as a household pest,
probably owing to the fact that carpets are seldom tacked down.
In fact, the writer believes that only where carpets are extensively
used in this way are the conditions favorable for the great increase
of this insect. Carpets once tacked down are seldom taken up for
a year, and in the meantime the insect develops uninterruptedly.
With the more general use of polished floors, and rugs which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"> 4 </a></span>
often taken up and beaten, there is little doubt that the "buffalo bug"
will eventually cease to be a household insect of importance. The
insect is known in Europe as infesting museums, but has not acquired
this habit to any great extent in this country. It is known to have
this habit in Cambridge, Mass., and Detroit, Mich., as well as in San
Francisco, Calif., but not in other localities. In each of these three
cases it was imported from Europe in insect collections.</p>

<p>The black carpet beetle derives its common name from the black,
unadorned color of the adult. Its larva is reddish or golden brown,
long and slender, with a characteristic tuft of long hairs at the end
of its body. It curls up and
"plays 'possum" when disturbed.
A glance at <a href="#fig5">Figure
5</a> will be sufficient for the
identification of this unique
carpet-beetle larva.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>&mdash;Black carpet beetle: Dorsal view of
adult beetle. Greatly enlarged.</div>
</div>

<p>Widespread in Europe
and Asia, it first attracted
attention in America in
1854. Since then it has
become widely distributed
throughout the United
States, often being the most
injurious of the carpet
beetles, especially in the
more southern States. It
is the carpet beetle most
commonly referred by housewives
to the department for
identification. It feeds upon
household fabrics of wool,
feathers, fur, hair, and silk,
and also upon cereals and cereal products, seeds, and dried animal
remains, hence has many opportunities for existence in warehouses
and barns as well as in houses.</p>

<p><b>The adult.</b>&mdash;The adult of the black carpet beetle is small, oval,
and black, as shown in <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>. The adults are present in abundance
only during the early summer. In a steam-heated building at
Washington, D. C, large numbers of adults were present late in
April and during May, but became rather scarce during the first
part of June, although single adults were found as late as early in
July. The adult flies readily and is often seen crawling on window
panes and screens. It is during the adult stage that the black carpet
beetle spreads most easily from house to house.</p>

<p>The female beetle lays small, white, fragile eggs upon fabrics, in
floor cracks, or in any sheltered spot near its food. The length of
life of the parent insect ranges from 3 to 35 days during April, May,
and June. Seldom are adults found later than July, except in very
warm storage houses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"> 5 </a></span></p>

<p><b>The egg.</b>&mdash;The fragile white eggs are very seldom seen, and hatch
in warm weather in about 6 to 10 days.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The larva.</b>&mdash;The golden brown larva, with short, stiff body hairs,
and its long tuft of hairs at the end of the body (<a href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>), attains a
length of one-fourth of an inch, exclusive of the tuft of hair at the
end of the body. When first hatched it is almost microscopic in size,
but increases rapidly under favorable food and climatic conditions.
As it grows it sheds its skin from five to eleven times, and possibly
oftener. This is of interest, for frequently the cast skins are mistaken
for the insect itself, thus unnecessarily
alarming the housewife concerning
the abundance of this carpet beetle. It required
approximately one year for larv&aelig;
to become fully grown when fed upon
casein. Larv&aelig; hatching during early June
and fed upon casein became full grown and
transformed to the adult stage during the
following April, May, and June. Larv&aelig;
fed upon woolen cloth and silk and flour
and meal were still only partially grown
at the end of one year, indicating that the
black carpet beetle may require two years
for its development. In India it has been
found that certain of these larv&aelig; may require
from one to three years for growth.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>&mdash;The varied carpet beetle:

</div>

<p><b>The pupa.</b>&mdash;In the pupa stage the insect
is white, clothed with fine white hairs (<a href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a>),
and helpless. The pupa stage continues
from 6 to 16 days during early summer at
Washington, D. C, and is seldom found at
any other season of the year.</p>

<p><b>Seasonal history.</b>&mdash;Since the greater part
of the life cycle is passed in the larva stage,
the facts previously mentioned indicate that
the black carpet beetle may have only one
generation each year, although it may require two or three years
for the same development. From the observation of the writer, made
in houses, warehouses, and in the laboratory at Washington, there
seems little doubt that a very large percentage of the insects have one
generation each year. Farther north, or under less favorable climatic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"> 6 </a></span>
and food conditions, a generation may require two or even three
years. At any rate, the adults are on the wing during early summer
and the eggs for new infestations are laid then.</p>

<p>The varied carpet beetle is similar
in shape to the common carpet beetle,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
but is a trifle smaller. It is called
the "varied" carpet beetle because the
color pattern on the back of the beetle
varies considerably with the arrangement
of the white, brownish, and yellowish
scales. <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a> presents a common
arrangement of the scales. The
underside of the body is thickly
clothed with white scales. This insect
is a European pest now well established
in widely separated parts of the
United States. It has been found more
often perhaps feeding upon seeds in
museums than upon clothing, though its larv&aelig; do attack woolen
goods, feathers, hair, and silks.</p>

<p>The larv&aelig; are not unlike other carpet beetle larv&aelig; of the genus
Anthrenus. In Figures <a href="#fig8">8</a> and <a href="#fig9">9</a> are shown the newly hatched and the
mature larv&aelig;. When unmutilated, they posses
on each side at the end of the body three
dense tufts of bristles and hairs. If suddenly
alarmed, the larv&aelig; erect these tufts and spread
the bristles and hairs out so as to form beautiful
round balls.</p>

<p>During late spring and early summer, when
the insect transforms to the adult stage in
greatest numbers, the adults are driven by
instinct to seek the bright sunshine and the
pollen of certain flowers. In this respect they
are not unlike other species of carpet beetles,
the adults of which may be found also upon
flowers. Some think that Viburnum or Spiraea
bushes planted near the house will lure
carpet beetles from the house. It is probably
true, however, that the beetles, before leaving
the house, lay a large percentage of their eggs,
so that the attraction the sun and flowers have
for them is of so little practical value to the
householder that it is not worth while to depend
upon flowers to lure the adults from the house.</p>

<p>The varied carpet beetle in the adult stage flies about in tremendous
numbers. During May, 1922, the writer could capture them
by the thousands upon at least 30 species of flowers found in public
gardens in Washington, D. C. Single white roses often attracted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"> 7 </a></span>
more than 100 beetles, while a single stalk of a common herbaceous
Spiraea harbored more than 1,000 specimens. The beetles often fly
in large numbers rather high above the ground. A gentleman<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> after
painting a portion of the tin roof of his house during early May returned
24 hours later to complete the painting, only to find that
during the interim an average of two varied carpet beetles to the
square inch had become entangled in the fresh paint. The writer
observed two adults fly into his city apartment in Washington
through an open window during early March, 1922. These flights
of adults are of extreme importance
to the householder, because they emphasize
how readily carpet beetles
may spread from house to house during
spring and early summer. Window
screens will exclude all except
the smallest specimens if they fit
tightly, but the average removable
screen does not fit tightly enough to
prevent adult carpet beetles from
crawling into the house between
screen and window frame.</p>

<p>The carpet beetle or dermestid<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
here discussed has had no common
name, but may be called the furniture
carpet beetle (<a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>). It, too, is a
European pest introduced into this
country. It has been reported from
Algeria, Spain, Greece, southern Russia
Mesopotamia, and the East Indies
It was first recognized in America
during 1911, from specimens sent
the American Museum of Natural
History, New York City, from an upholsterer
in Augusta, Ga. The specimen
were taken from the curled hair
of furniture upholstered 12 to 15
years previous to 1911. Investigation
indicated that the hair used in
this furniture came from Russia. The pest was not again noted in
America until April, 1915, when it was found seriously damaging an
upholstered chair in the White House. Since then, particularly during
the last several years, many pieces of furniture and mattresses in
different sections have been reported badly damaged.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> So called because, like the other carpet beetles, it belongs to the family Dermestidae.</p></div>

<p>In all instances the furniture was upholstered with curled hair
and moss, and in some cases the hair had been completely devoured
by the larv&aelig;, in association with smaller numbers of the common
carpet beetle, the black carpet beetle, and the webbing clothes moth.
(Figs. <a href="#fig11">11</a> and <a href="#fig12">12</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"> 8 </a></span></p>

<p>This beetle is now well established in this country and is a most
serious furniture pest. The adults eat holes through heavy leather
and linen coverings, while the larv&aelig; reduce the hair used in the
upholstering to a mass of cast larval skins and ground-up hair.
The hair then has the appearance of black gritty dirt which can be
scraped up by the handful, if not by the pailful. When the larv&aelig;
become abundant in a piece of furniture they may drop to the floor
and there feed upon rugs and other fabrics made of wool, hair, fur,
or feathers. The larva; or grubs are seldom seen unless searched for,
but the adults, because of their habit of flight during March to June
(in Washington), leave the furniture and crawl about the furnishings
and windows, and while hardly one-fourth of an inch long, are made
conspicuous by the brown, white, and yellow scales that cover their
bodies.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>&mdash;Upholstered furniture sometimes harbors thousands of clothes moths and
carpet beetles without showing evidence of their feeding until they have become

rid such a piece of furniture of pests.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"> 9 </a></span></p>

<p>For a general impression of the appearance of the furniture carpet
beetle see <a href="#fig10">Figure 10</a>. The adult may live several weeks. The
female has been known to lay as many as 36 eggs in one day. Fortunately
this species does not seem to be very prolific, since no adult
has been known to lay more than 85 eggs. The eggs are small, white,
easily crushed by brushing, and are laid in the nap of clothing. In
furniture coverings of mohair, plush, and similar materials the eggs
are tucked down in the pile, as shown in <a href="#fig13">Figure 13</a>. The eggs hatch
during warm summer weather in from 12 to 15 days. The larv&aelig; require
the rest of the year for growth and do not transform to the
adult until the following spring. The larv&aelig;, however, do not all
grow equally well, and some specimens may require only one year
for development, while others may remain for considerable periods
somewhat dormant, even in the presence of much food, and will not
transform to the adult until much later, sometimes as long as one
year after others, hatching on the same day, have matured.</p>

numbers of clothes moths and black carpet beetles, has eaten nearly all the curled
hair stuffing, leaving behind the moss used with the hair, countless larval skins, and
handfuls of a fine, gritty, dirtlike substance which is nothing more nor less than the
frass of the insect. Thousands of carpet beetles can mature in such furniture without
the knowledge of the casual observer. It is only when the stuffing is eaten
away and the pests leave the furniture and crawl about the house that suspicion is
centered upon furniture as the possible source of an unending supply of clothes
moths and carpet beetles that appear here and there about the house.</div>

<p>The measures to be used for the control of carpet beetles depend
upon the place in the house where the pest is causing injury. If
carpet beetles are troublesome in trunks, chests, or closets that are not
opened often, a good grade of flake naphthalene, paradichlorobenzene
or camphor will give good results. If the trouble is in closets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"> 10 </a></span>
in daily use, beneath carpets or rugs, or in piano felts or upholstered
furniture, these substances are of practically no value, and one must
fumigate the house as a whole or in part with either hydrocyanic-acid
gas, carbon disulphid, or carbon tetrachlorid, or use the still
older, more tedious, and less effective means of control consisting in
frequent search for and the killing of the individual larv&aelig; and
adults, and the treatment of floor cracks and similar hiding places
with kerosene, gasoline, or benzine. The following materials and
methods may be employed with satisfactory results:</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="NAPHTHALENE" name="NAPHTHALENE"></a>NAPHTHALENE.</p>

<p>Naphthalene in the form of
flakes (preferably) or moth
balls is effective when used at
the rate of one-half to 1 pound
to each 10 to 13 cubic feet of
space. It is always better to
use a larger rather than a
smaller quantity of these crystals
Great care should be exercised
to keep tightly closed
the trunks or chests of clothing
with which the naphthalene is
stored. Naphthalene in chests
opened frequently or those carelessly
left open for hours at a
time, or in chests with large
cracks or warped covers, is not
to be depended upon. Naphthalene
should be of good grade.
It is best to purchase it put up
in unbroken tin cans of 1 pound
or more capacity. Remember
that naphthalene kills all stages
of the carpet beetles by means
of the fumes given off during the slow evaporation of its crystals and
it is essential that these fumes be closely confined. Naphthalene in
bureau drawers, in closets frequently used, scattered upon closet
shelves, or beneath carpets is not to be depended upon for absolute
protection.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="PARADICHLOROBENZENE" name="PARADICHLOROBENZENE"></a>PARADICHLOROBENZENE.</p>

<p>Paradichlorobenzene crystals are similar in general appearance to
those of naphthalene. The fumes given off by the slow evaporation
of the crystals in a tightly closed container will kill all stages of the
carpet beetle, if about 1 pound of crystals is used for each 10 cubic
feet of space.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="CAMPHOR" name="CAMPHOR"></a>CAMPHOR.</p>

<p>Camphor is not as quickly effective against all stages of carpet
beetles as are naphthalene and paradichlorobenzene. Its action is
slower. Use from one-half to 1 pound for each trunk of about 10
cubic feet capacity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"> 11 </a></span></p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="RED-CEDAR_CHESTS" name="RED-CEDAR_CHESTS"></a>RED-CEDAR CHESTS.</p>

<p>Chests made of red cedar, popularly known as Virginia<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> or Tennessee
red cedar, if well constructed, will kill the very young larv&aelig;
of carpet beetles. They will not kill the beetles, the older larv&aelig;, or
the pupae, nor will they prevent the eggs from hatching. The writer
has known larv&aelig; of the black carpet beetle<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> to remain apparently
unaffected in a red-cedar chest from June of one year to May of the
following year, and then to transform normally to the adult stage.
The older larv&aelig; of carpet beetles can be removed from clothing before
it is stored in chests by thorough brushing. It is valuable
to know that red-cedar chests will kill the very young larv&aelig;. It
should always be remembered that articles such as balls of yarn,
floor skins backed with woolen cloth, pillows stuffed with hair or
feathers, and similar objects in the interior of which the older carpet-beetle
larv&aelig; can hide should not be placed in cedar chests until
fumigated to kill the larv&aelig; hidden where they can not be reached
by brushing.</p>

</div>


<p class="caption3"><a id="COLD_STORAGE" name="COLD_STORAGE"></a>COLD STORAGE.</p>

<p>One of the safest methods of preventing loss through carpet-beetle
attack is to store susceptible articles with a reliable cold-storage firm
maintaining rooms for such purposes at a temperature of 50&deg; F. or
lower.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="FUMIGATION" name="FUMIGATION"></a>FUMIGATION.</p>

<p>Carpet beetles, as well as all other household pests, can be eliminated
as disturbing factors by fumigation within as short a time as
three or four hours (if necessary). Fumigation with formaldehyde
candles, although excellent for killing disease germs, is worthless
for insect control, and the public is warned accordingly. Sulphur
fumes will kill many carpet beetles, but very few persons succeed
in killing all carpet beetles with sulphur fumes. Sulphur should be
burned at the rate of 13 ounces per 1,000 cubic feet of space. It is
likely to bleach wall paper and fine fabrics and tarnish metals, and
should never be used unless one is aware of these possible bad results.</p>

<p><b>Hydrocyanic-acid gas.</b>&mdash;Hydrocyanic-acid gas is the best gas
known and in present use for the fumigation of houses, or parts of
houses, for the speedy elimination of carpet beetles or other pests.
When persons are troubled with fabric pests that have become
generally established throughout the house, nothing will give greater
satisfaction in peace of mind and freedom from trouble than one
thorough fumigation carried on by a professional fumigator or by
any intelligent, careful person capable of following directions. Hydrocyanic-acid
gas is dangerous to human beings, but is noninflammable
and nonexplosive as used in household fumigation as here
advocated. It is lighter than air, will injure no fabric or painting,
and will not tarnish household metals. If properly used, it is one of
the simplest and best methods of fighting house pests. Interested
persons can have full particulars free of cost by writing the Division
of Publications, Department of Agriculture, for Farmers' Bulletin
699.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"> 12 </a></span></p>

<p><b>Carbon disulphid.</b>&mdash;Carbon disulphid is a fumigant in general use
for killing insects of all sorts in containers that are reasonably tight.
It is excellent for killing carpet beetles in chests, trunks, and closets
that can be closed and sealed. It has been used for the fumigation of
entire buildings when these are detached. It is purchased at drug
stores or of chemical firms as a liquid put up in tin cans containing
1, 2, 5, or 10 pounds each. Upon exposure to the air, the liquid
evaporates, forming a gas heavier than air which sinks through the
container being fumigated and kills the insects by suffocation. The
gas is explosive in the presence of fire, and must be handled with the
same care as gasoline or benzine. Although the liquid as purchased is
considered not explosive or inflammable, great care should be exercised
in storing and handling it since it is almost impossible to dissociate
it from its gas, which is, as stated above, decidedly explosive
and inflammable in the presence of fire. The odor of carbon disulphid
gas is very disagreeable, but soon disappears with the airing
of the container after fumigation. Carbon disulphid fumigation is
excellent for the destruction of carpet beetles in articles that can be
stored in trunks, chests, or closets, or for killing pests in pianos and
upholstered furniture that can be placed in a small room for the
period of fumigation. Full particulars regarding this fumigant and
the ease with which it can be used may be had by writing the Division
of Publications, Department of Agriculture, for Farmers' Bulletin
799.</p>

<p><b>Carbon tetrachlorid.</b>&mdash;Carbon tetrachlorid is used in exactly the
same way and for the same purpose as carbon disulphid, except that
from two to three times as much of the liquid must be used to fumigate
the same amount of space. Carbon tetrachlorid is not a particularly
effective fumigant, but it has the advantage of producing, upon
evaporation, a gas that is noninflammable and nonexplosive, and for
this reason can be used in certain places where lighted lamps, fires,
etc., can not be entirely eliminated. See Farmers' Bulletin 799 for
reference to use of carbon tetrachlorid and carbon disulphid.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="MISCELLANEOUS" name="MISCELLANEOUS"></a>MISCELLANEOUS CONTROL MEASURES.</p>

<p><b>Laundering and dry cleaning.</b>&mdash;When material infested with carpet
beetles is submerged in a solution of 1 pound of neutral soap to
10 gallons of water all stages of the beetles are killed. Carpet-beetle
larv&aelig; are killed if subjected to temperatures of 120, 125, and 128&deg; F.
for 30, 15, and 10 minutes, respectively. Eggs are killed when subjected
to temperatures of 125 and 130&deg; F. for 16 and 11 minutes, respectively
Eggs and larv&aelig; were killed in material dipped for 5 second
in water at 140&deg; F., but submergence for the same period in
water at a temperature of 122&deg; F. failed to kill all of them. Translated
into household terms this means that laundering clothing or
other textiles in thick suds or with water hotter than the hand can
bear, or pressing with a hot iron, will probably kill the larv&aelig; and
eggs of the carpet beetle. The usual commercial dry-cleaning processes
also are probably effective. Unfortunately these methods are
not always easily applied to the articles most likely to be infested;
they must not be considered a preventive against reinfestation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"> 13 </a></span></p>

<p><b>Treatment of floor cracks and other hiding places.</b>&mdash;Carpet-beetle
larv&aelig; often secrete themselves in the cracks of flooring, beneath base
boards, and in other openings about houses formed by the usual
shrinking or settling of woodwork. The larv&aelig; feed upon the lint
which gathers in such places. It is, therefore, an excellent procedure
to have all such openings closed where possible by filling in with
putty or patented crack-fillers. Any cracks that can not be filled
in this manner should be periodically filled with gasoline, kerosene,
or benzine to kill larv&aelig;. Since these liquids are inflammable, care
must be exercised not to have lighted lamps or fire in any form about
until after the rooms are well ventilated.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
